        <ContentText>&lt;p&gt;A man in&amp;nbsp;New Brunswick who recently travelled to the Dominican
            Republic&amp;nbsp;is facing an&amp;nbsp;assault charge for allegedly coughing in another
            person's&amp;nbsp;face after saying he was feeling ill.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Police said they&amp;nbsp;responded to a call&amp;nbsp;Thursday morning&amp;nbsp;from
            a&amp;nbsp;home in Rothesay&amp;nbsp;concerning two people who had allegedly failed to isolate themselves
            after returning home from travelling abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A&amp;nbsp;33-year-old&amp;nbsp;man was arrested at the&amp;nbsp;home&amp;nbsp;for uttering
            threats&amp;nbsp;and for assault after "purposely coughing in someone's face," the Kennebecasis Regional
            Police Force&amp;nbsp;said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Police Insp. Anika Becker said the accused doesn't live at the home in question, but&amp;nbsp;his
            travelling companion does.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Becker said another occupant of the home —&amp;nbsp;a 41-year-old man —&amp;nbsp;had complained
            about the pair's failure to self isolate, as required by the province. That's when the coughing started,
            Becker said.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the province's emergency rules for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, anyone who returns to
            the province after travelling abroad&amp;nbsp;must self-isolate for 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Becker said the accused was released on a promise to appear in court in Saint John,
            N.B.,&amp;nbsp;on July 9. He is also prohibited from&amp;nbsp;having any contact with the victim.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As for the officers who responded to the complaint, Becker said all of them&amp;nbsp;were
            wearing&amp;nbsp;personal protection equipment, including&amp;nbsp;masks, goggles and gloves.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New Brunswick declared a state of emergency on March 19 after&amp;nbsp;Premier Blaine
            Higgs&amp;nbsp;said too few citizens were following orders to avoid public gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;"If anyone has concerns that someone is not self-isolating properly, they should not take matters
            in their own hands," Kennebecasis police said in a statement, adding that the province has established a
            toll-free non-compliance phone line.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, police in western Newfoundland confirmed that&amp;nbsp;a woman&amp;nbsp;had been
            arrested for a second time&amp;nbsp;after allegedly refusing to stay inside following her return from travel
            outside the province.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 53-year-old was arrested in the Curling area of Corner Brook, one day after she was released
            from custody for contravening special orders under Newfoundland and Labrador's Public Health Protection and
            Promotion Act.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The woman has been charged with failing to abide by the special&amp;nbsp;order and two counts of
            breaching a release order. She could be fined&amp;nbsp;between $500 and
            $2,500&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;jailed&amp;nbsp;up to six months.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In Quebec City, police arrested a woman&amp;nbsp;last week&amp;nbsp;who they said was infected with
            the virus and&amp;nbsp;was walking&amp;nbsp;outside after being ordered&amp;nbsp;to stay indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese&amp;nbsp;in St. John's, N.L.&amp;nbsp;closed all of its
            churches on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Archbishop Peter Hundt says&amp;nbsp;the churches are now offering mass and other
            spiritual&amp;nbsp;rites through Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In Halifax, the local transit authority&amp;nbsp;says&amp;nbsp;bus service&amp;nbsp;has
            been&amp;nbsp;reduced because of a lack of&amp;nbsp;staff. The municipality says riders can&amp;nbsp;expect
            delays and route cancellations.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The union that represents transit workers confirmed&amp;nbsp;Thursday one of its&amp;nbsp;mechanics
            was among&amp;nbsp;those who've tested positive for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In Newfoundland and Labrador, the&amp;nbsp;ferry service&amp;nbsp;linking&amp;nbsp;the province
            with Nova Scotia&amp;nbsp;will be&amp;nbsp;imposing&amp;nbsp;strict passenger limits as&amp;nbsp;of April 1.
            Marine Atlantic says its&amp;nbsp;ferries&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;carry only 100 passengers per crossing to
            ensure social distancing.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Screening measures will also&amp;nbsp;prevent anyone&amp;nbsp;from boarding a ferry if they
            are&amp;nbsp;showing&amp;nbsp;symptoms, including fever, cough and difficulty breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 27, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;— By Michael MacDonald in Halifax, with files from Kevin Bissett in Fredericton.&lt;/p&gt;
